title: About
---

I am a certified Salesforce Administrator with a customer service background and a proven track record of providing assistance wherever needed. Having spent 8 years in the Army Reserves, including one year of active duty in a combat zone, I developed adaptability and the ability to learn from and teach those around me. Following that, I dedicated another 8 years to managing a small security team in a hospital environment, guiding team members to excel in their roles or advance to new opportunities. In my free time, I delve into independent projects, embark on exciting motorcycle journeys, and consistently expand my knowledge of systems that intrigue me.
