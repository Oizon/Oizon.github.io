title: About
---

As a certified Salesforce Developer and Administrator at America's Warrior Partnership, I bring a unique blend of customer service expertise and military experience to the tech world. With a background in the Army Reserves, including active duty in a combat zone, I've learned to adapt seamlessly to any challenge. During my 8-year military journey, I not only gained valuable insights but also shared my knowledge with others. Transitioning to civilian life, I spent 8 years managing a security team in a hospital, fostering professional growth. In my spare time, I delve into independent projects, embark on motorcycle adventures, and stay curious about evolving systems.
